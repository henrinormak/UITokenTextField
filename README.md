UITokenTextField
================

`UITokenTextField` is a simple UIControl subclass, that allows iOS' Mail.app like tokenised textfield entry. 
The characters used for tokenising can be changed and a few handy delegate callbacks allow controlling the input, for example limiting it to email addresses etc.

The drawing of the tokenised labels is completely customisable, for example you can change the colors by simply changing the properties `fillColor`, `strokeColor`, `highlightedFillColor` and `highlightedStrokeColor` of the `UITokenLabel` instances the text field creates. 

Feel free to use as you wish.
